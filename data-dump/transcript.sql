INSERT INTO public.transcript (id, content, json) VALUES (2, e'Okay so I think we can agree that onions are one of the most used vegetables because we dice them up and put them in virtually everything but have you ever stopped to think about how beautiful those layers are? This Middle Eastern stuffed onions dish is truly the dish that appreciates the humble onion. The onions are peeled and then sliced just halfway to the center and then to make them really easy to stuff we steam them in the microwave to soften. Then comes the vegetarian rice-based filling. It\'s full of herbs, vegetables, spices and my secret ingredient pomegranate molasses. Now comes the fun part. You slowly and gently peel and separate the layers and bonus you actually don\'t cry while doing this. Stuff each layer with the rice filling not too much and then line them in an oven safe baking pan with a lid. Pour a tomato-based broth all over, cover and bake until the onions are deliciously soft, sweet and tangy.

Just transfer everything to a blender, remove the crispy thyme, squeeze out the garlic, and blend it all with vegetable broth. It transforms into a creamy broccoli and cheese soup that\'s loaded with so much flavor and perfect for cold winter days. So good!

INSERT INTO public.transcript (id, content, json) VALUES (5, e'I don\'t know about you, but I think the best kind of roses are ones made of potatoes and thankfully they couldn\'t be easier to make. Cheers! We\'re going to start by thinly slicing the potatoes and then patting them dry and tossing them with olive oil, rosemary, garlic, salt and pepper. Then spread them out in a row and top them with some parmesan and then roll them up and secure them with some bacon so it keeps them intact. Then pop them in the oven until they\'re knife tender and they\'re crispy around the edges and there you have yourself some absolutely delicious potato roses and the full recipe is just below. Enjoy!

I swap the pasta with chickpeas for extra fibre and mix all together to create the most comforting recipe, perfect to serve with some toasted bread. And honestly, it was buonissimo!
