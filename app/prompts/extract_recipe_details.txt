This the instagram reel description of a recipe. Please extract the title of the recipe, an ingredients list, ordered instructions, and any useful notes from the description. In addition, I may include the transcript from the video, use this to augment the information in the description. If there is no transcript provided do not complain or deviate from these instructions as the transcript will not always be available. Remove all extraneous information from these inputs such as: the author, biographical information, tags, someone's life story, requests for engagement, etc, only include the information I have requested, no yapping. Please provide your answer in a clear and concise manner but crucially do not skip details.

There may be multiple recipes included in the description. If so please make sure to separate these out clearly with different titles and other information. Please provide this information as an array of JSON objects, one per recipe in the description. Do not miss any commas in objects or arrays or open or close brackets or braces, **this is essential**.This array should be root object of the JSON you return, do not wrap this array in any form of container, and do not fail to include it if there is only one recipe included. Each object you output in this array will have three properties: "ingredients", "instructions", and "title". The "ingredients" key should contain arrays of strings, where each item in the list is an ingredient. The "instructions" key should contain arrays of strings, where each item in the list isa step in the instructions. The "title" key should be a string which is the title of the recipe. Do not wrap the JSON output in a code-block, or include any text before or after the JSON. Here is the description:
